# Snake-game
In this project I implemented the "Snake" game in the C language.
The snake is constantly moving forward and the user can change direction using the keyboard keys.
During the game, "fruits" are scattered on the game board, which the snake can eat and grow.
When the snake eats 10 fruits and does not collide with the wall, it wins the game.
A collision with the wall is considered a disqualification and the game starts over.
